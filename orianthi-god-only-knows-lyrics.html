<p>~ Lyrics to Song ~</p>

<p>I feel so alone, can't seem to find my out of this lone? No, it don't seem right I didn't have a chance to say goodbye.</p>

<p>In this this silent space, I close my eyes I can hear you say That it's alright, but my world's such an empty place tonight. Cause I know that, it's all part of life.</p>

<p>I wish I had the chance to say goodbye, yeah I still miss you. So hard to see through the tears I've cried. Yeah, I still need you. Cause I don't want to, if I don't have to ever let you go. The longest I'll hold on... God only knows.</p>

<p>As the time goes by, it gets a little easier to smile. I know I'll never forget everything that you said. You said it's alright, it's all part of life.</p>

<p>I wish I had the chance to say goodbye, yeah I still miss you. So hard to see through the tears I've cried. Yeah, I still need you. Cause I don't want to, if I don't have to ever let you go. The longest I'll hold on... God only knows.</p>

<p>{The hard times} will never fade if you keep looking up Right around there is a better place if you believe in love. Cause I know that, it's all part of life.</p>

<p>I wish I had the chance to say goodbye, yeah I still miss you. So hard to see through the tears I've cried. Yeah, I still need you. Cause I don't want to, if I don't have to ever let you go. The longest I'll hold on, the longest I'll hold on. The longest I'll hold on... God only knows. God only knows. Yeah, God only knows. God only knows.</p>
