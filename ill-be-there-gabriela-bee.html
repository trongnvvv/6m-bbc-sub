<p>When the tears are rolling down<br>
Like a river to the ocean<br>
And there's no one else around<br>
You won't question my devotion</p>

<p>Everybody needs somebody<br>
And you got me<br>
You know that I know that you know that</p>

<p>I'll be there for the highs and lows<br>
Give you mine if your heart gets broke<br>
By your side when you're all alone<br>
I will be there</p>

<p>When you're down d-down on your luck<br>
No ride home and you got too drunk<br>
2AM I'mma pick you up<br>
I will be there ay</p>

<p>I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there for you<br>
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there for you</p>

<p>When you're down d-down on your luck<br>
No ride home and you got too drunk<br>
Whoa<br>
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there for you</p>

<p>When your heart could use a break<br>
And it's too broken to be open<br>
I'll be patient, I will wait<br>
Until you're ready to be open</p>

<p>Everybody (Everybody)<br>
Needs somebody (needs somebody)<br>
And you got me<br>
You know that I know that you know that</p>

<p>I'll be there for the highs and lows<br>
Give you mine if your heart gets broke<br>
By your side when you're all alone<br>
I will be there</p>

<p>When you're down d-down on your luck<br>
No ride home and you got too drunk<br>
2AM I'mma pick you up<br>
I will be there ay</p>

<p>I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there for you<br>
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there for you</p>

<p>When you're down d-down on your luck<br>
No ride home and you got too drunk<br>
Whoa<br>
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there for you</p>

<p>I'll be there for the highs and lows<br>
Give you mine when your heart gets broke<br>
By your side when you're all alone<br>
I will be there</p>

<p>When you're down d-down on your luck<br>
Gave your all but it's not enough<br>
Take my hand and I'll pick you up<br>
I will be there<br>
(I will be there)</p>

<p>I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there for you<br>
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there for you</p>

<p>When you're down d-down on your luck<br>
No ride home and you got too drunk<br>
Whoa<br>
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there for you<br>
I'll be there for you</p>
